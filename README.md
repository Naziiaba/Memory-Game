## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play?

In this game Player has to match two card. If cards match, they color change to green. If all cards are green - Player wins! Player gets starts after finished game. Amount of stars depends from moves:

3 stars - less than 30 moves.

2 stars - between 30 - 50 moves.

1 star - more than 50 moves.

When Player will win, may type own name to leaderboard. Player`s score depends from combination time and moves.
